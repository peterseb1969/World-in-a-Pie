Execute Phase 2 (Data Model Design) of the AI-Assisted Development process.

### Prerequisites
Phase 1 must be complete. You must have:
- Verified WIP MCP server connectivity
- Inventoried all existing terminologies and templates

### Steps

1. If the user provides a use case document, read it for domain context.
2. Ask the user about their specific requirements:
   - What data do they want to store?
   - What are the entities?
   - What makes each entity unique (identity fields)?
   - What fields have controlled/repeating values (terminology candidates)?
   - **Are any vocabularies hierarchical?** (e.g., species taxonomy, disease classification, org chart, product categories, geographic containment) — these need ontology relations (is_a, part_of, etc.) alongside the flat term list.
   - Are there relations between entities?
   - Do external systems have their own IDs (synonym candidates)?
3. If the user provides sample data (CSV, JSON, spreadsheet), analyze it:
   - Identify columns and data types
   - Detect repeating value columns (terminology candidates)
   - Identify natural keys (identity field candidates)
   - Note data quality issues
4. **Check what already exists using MCP tools.** This is critical — do not skip.
   - Call `list_terminologies` — can any existing terminology be reused?
   - Call `list_terms(terminology_id)` — do existing terms cover the needed values?
   - Call `get_template_fields(template_value)` for any relevant existing templates — could the new entity extend an existing template?
   - Flag reusable entities clearly in your proposal. DO NOT propose recreating anything that exists.
5. Design the data model and present it to the user as a clear proposal:

   For each terminology:
   - Value (unique code), label, description
   - Initial terms with aliases
   - Whether it already exists in WIP (reuse) or needs to be created (new)
   - **Ontology relations** (if hierarchical): which terms are parents/children, what relation type (is_a, part_of, has_part, etc.). Show the hierarchy tree.

   For each template:
   - Value (unique code), label, description
   - All fields: name, label, type, mandatory (NOT "required"), terminology_ref, template_ref
   - **Identity fields** — explain WHY these were chosen and how they affect versioning
   - References to other templates (and which must be created first)
   - Whether it extends an existing template

   Show creation order:
   - Which terminologies first
   - Which templates first (referenced before referencing)
   - Dependency diagram if complex

6. **STOP and wait for user approval.** Do not proceed to Phase 3 until the user explicitly approves the data model.

### Field Naming — Use WIP's Names
- `mandatory: true` (NOT `required: true`)
- `terminology_ref: "COUNTRY"` (NOT `terminology_id`)
- `template_ref: "PARENT_TEMPLATE"` (NOT `template_id`)
- Terminology/template identifiers are called `value` (NOT `code` or `name`)
- Display names are called `label` (NOT `name`)

### Gate
The user must explicitly say they approve the data model. Phrases like "looks good", "go ahead", "approved" count. Questions, concerns, or "let me think about it" do NOT count — wait.
